An app that collects and maps stories on how climate change affects the natural and human environment on a local scale.

I used the [gmaps4rails](https://github.com/apneadiving/Google-Maps-for-Rails) gem, with help from this [great tutorial](http://andyglassblog.wordpress.com/2012/07/06/google-maps-for-rails-with-gmaps4-rails-tutorial-on-how-to-post-and-filter-locations/), and the [Geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder) gem for locating by IP address.

It also uses the [twilio-ruby](https://github.com/twilio/twilio-ruby) gem to allow texting stories to the app. [This demo](https://github.com/crabasa/twilio-rails-demo) helped me set that up.

Created for the [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) [WDI Boston 2013](https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive/boston) first project.
